*Players and Instructions*

As the previous section shows, you can use Composer simply to describe musical events in a score and turn that description into an actual musical file that plays on your computer.  But the language also supports aleatoric features.

First, beyond the statements for defining musical events directly, there are statements supporting the notions of players who play a score, and players in an ensemble playing a score together.
 
A @player@ is assigned a name and also assigned notes in either @section@, @phrase@ or @note@ blocks below the player.  Players are then instructed in the score to @play@ and the results are @rendered into the final result:
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;@player "Player 1"@</br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@phrase "Phrase 1"@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@note "1"@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@instrument  1@</br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@start       1.0@</br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@duration    0.5@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@amplitude   1000@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@pitch       7.01@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@note "2"@
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@instrument  2@</br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@start       2.0@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@duration    1.0@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@amplitude   1100@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@pitch       7.02@</br>
</br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;@play@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@players "Player 1", "Player 2"@</br> 
</br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;@render "my_composition.wav"@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@players "Player 1", "Player 2"@</br>      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@format    csound@</br>  
      
In this simplest form, the result is no different then if the notes had simply been defined directly.  But, crucially, Composer also supports arbitrary directions that the composer intends players to follow.  These are defined using the @instruction@ statement:
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;@instruction "Fortissimo"@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@description "Player should play each note twice as loud as the notated volume of the note."@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@players     "Player 1"@</br>
 
An instruction is named (with any text you desire), and has a @description@ which is just one or more sentences that describe the composer's intentions.  So, in this way an instruction can fulfill any aleatoric compositional goal.

If players have been assigned an instruction, then the instruction affects their performance when they play.  For example, here "Player 1" will play "Fortissimo" but "Player 2" will not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;@instruction "Fortissimo"@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@description "Player should play each note twice as loud as the notated volume of the note."@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@players     "Player 1"@</br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;@play@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@players "Player 1", "Player 2"@</br> 

*Ensembles, Player and Instructions*

Players can also be organized into ensembles using the @ensemble@ statement.  Like phrases and sections that group notes, @ensemble@ groups one or more players that can be referenced by the name of the ensemble.  As you might expect, if an ensemble is named in an @ensembles@ list in a @play@ block, then all players in that ensemble will play:
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;@ensemble "Ensemble 100"@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@players "Player 1", "Player 2"@</br>  
</br>    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@phrase "Phrase 1"@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@note "1"@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@instrument  1@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@start       1.0@</br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@duration    0.5@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@amplitude   1000@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@pitch       7.01@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@func_table  1@</br>
</br>        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@note "2"@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@instrument  2@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@start       2.0@</br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@duration    1.0@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@amplitude   1100@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@pitch       7.02@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@func_table  1@</br>
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@play@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@ensembles "Ensemble 100"@</br>
 
More interestingly, instructions can also be assigned to ensembles as well as individual players.  This supports performance directions that are intended for an entire ensemble to follow.  For example, Terry Riley's composition "In C" includes this instruction in the score, "As an ensemble, it is very desirable to play very softly as well as very loudly and to try to diminuendo and crescendo together."  Clearly this requires an instruction that is aware of what all the players in the ensemble are playing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;@instruction "Ensemble Diminuendo and Crescendo"@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@description "As an ensemble, it is very desirable to play very softly as well as very loudly and to try to diminuendo and crescendo together."@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@ensembles "In C Orchestra"@</br>

*Improvise Instructions*
 
Finally, Composer supports the notion of 'improvisation' directions in the score and an @improvise@ statement instructing players to improvise notes based on that direction.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;@improvisation "Rock out extremely hard"@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@description "Never stop rockin', ever, seriously.  No, really, I mean never, ever."@</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@players "Player 1"@</br>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@improvise@</br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@players "Player 1"@</br>

*Instructions and Improvisations Direct the Collaborating Programmer*

The name and @description@ of your @instruction@ and @improvisation@ elements in your score are your direction to the programmer who will interpret your score to create the players to play it.  It is important to fully communicate your intent, especially in the @description@ block.  Remember that both the name and description can say anything you want, as long as you put it between starting and ending " characters.

A Composer score simply includes the @instruction@ and its @description@, while the code that enacts the instruction is written by a programmer in a different file.  In that file they refer to the instruction by the name you give it, telling Aleatoric to use their to direct each @player@ when playing your @instruction@.
