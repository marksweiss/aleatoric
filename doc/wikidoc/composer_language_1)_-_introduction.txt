_*Composer Reference and Tutorial*_

*Introduction and Examples*<br/><br/>

You use the Composer language to define musical scores.  Scores have two distinct concerns, defining musical events and, optionally, defining players and ensembles to play notes and act on additional performance directions.

You can simply define notes and tell Aleatoric to render them, in which case you are using Composer much like traditional musical notation.  If your intention is to both define musical events and provide guidance to the imaginary software performers of those notes, you can do that by defining a @player@ or many and an @ensemble@ and giving them an @instruction@ or many about performance (or, really anything you want) or defining one or more of an @improvisation@.  Also, without doing any programming, you can use the @repeat@ statement to repeat any section of the score as many times as you want.

Let's start with two simple but complete scripts.
