# Notes can be added to Phrases (which group added Notes under a name)
#  and to Sections (which group added Notes or added Phrases under a name)
#  and to Players (which can play any Notes, Phrases or Sections added to them)
add notes
to
  phrase "intro", "intro_copy"
#  section "intro 1"
#  player "bassist", "oboist"

# As per previous comment, here we add the phrases created in the previous step
#  to both a Player and a Section
# add phrases "intro", "intro copy" 
# to
#  player "drummer"
#  section "intro 2", "intro 3"

# This writes output to a format that can be rendered into a sound file
# The syntax for specifying this is first a "key" indicating the type of value 
#  being specified -- in this case we are specifying a format to write to.
#  The second element is the value for the type of value -- so we are specifying
#  a format, and the format in this case is csound
# write format => csound

# Alternate, unadorned one-line notation for a note, entries must be delimited with semicolon

# One-line notation for a note, with arrow notation for attrs and values. 
# Entries must be delimited with commas, keys must be symbols

# Or you can not indent and just put entries one to a line, but that seems less readable
