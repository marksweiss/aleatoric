# TODO and ROADMAP

- Document Composer language for composers and programmers, on project Wiki
- Add MIDI format support for rendering scores to MIDI files
- Port "In C" to use the library, to provide a non-trivial example of implementing aleatoric directions using the programmers' API
- Minor simplifications, feature requests and bug fixes suggested by users
- Complete and as simple as possible installation and configuration packages for Windows, Mac and Linux
