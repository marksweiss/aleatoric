# TODO and ROADMAP

* Document Aleatoric programmer's API for implementing performance instructions
* MIDI import -- open an existing MIDI file, load all notes and conver to Composer measures and notes, outputting that as text. This lets users easily build new compositions from existing MIDI files.  This lets user use an existing MIDI editor to define notes (much less annoying then writing them in a text file as they must now) and then save the .mid file and import it into Aleatoric.  Nice.
* Real installers for Mac, Windows and Linux, supporting configuration and installing all dependencies as well as the source
