Could make this a back end for aleatoric, https://audiofile.cc/.  Which is awesome, because then aleatoric could produce output that will run in any modern browser.  Which means you could make it a web service that rendered compositions and played them back in the browser, i.e. could make the entire thing a web app -- drop your script in a form, submit, play back in the browser.  Would be an awesomely cool first Rails/HTML 5 app.
